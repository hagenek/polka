_Students at [\</salt> Fall2020](https://salt.study/) were required to make a web application from scratch in a timeframe of two weeks. Our group consisted of Adrian Nesvik, Georg Ekeberg, Helari Sosi and Joakim Andersson and this is the result of our final project._

## Installation and setup

### Install

Use yarn to install dependencies by running the following command in the server and client directories.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start the application

To start the development servers you will need to run the following command in the server directory

```bash
yarn dev
```

and in the client directory

```bash
yarn start
```

The frontend will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ and the backend will be accessible on http://localhost:1337/
