## The flow of pushing your changes

1. Make sure you are working on your own local branch (NOT dev) - commit everything you do there locally --> git commit -am "added a great feature"

2. Go to the dev branch and do the following: 
   - git checkout dev
   - git pull
   - git merge [Your local branch]
   - git push
   - git checkout [your local branch]
   - git merge dev

3. Questions: Ask Georg.
