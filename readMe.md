_Students at [\</salt> Fall2020](https://salt.study/) were required to make a web application from scratch in a timeframe of two weeks. Our group consisted of Adrian Nesvik, Georg Ekeberg, Helari Sosi and Joakim Andersson and this is the result of our final project._

## The project is live at https://polkat.herokuapp.com/


## Installation and setup
