            Let's change the system - one friendship at a time!
            People with disability are excluded from the traditional ways of making friends and are also isolated and excluded from society. 
            As a result of these two factors, people with disability often find it harder to make and sustain connections. 
            Friendships are very important aspects of social inclusion as they provide people with an opportunity to build a network of people around them that are their own age. 
            Friendships also allow people to express their ideas in a safe environment, and generally have some fun and a laugh.
